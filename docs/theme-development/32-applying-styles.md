Traditionally, theme authors would style everything from a stylesheet—and they still
sometimes must. In modern Zelocorecms, you can also style most, if not all, of your
theme directly from your `theme.json` file.

When you use this standard system, it is also reflected in the **Appearance > Editor
> Styles** interface. This means your theme’s users with access to that admin screen
can also make changes that easily work alongside your theme’s styles. But it also
means that you can design your theme directly from this visual interface if you 
choose to do so.

`theme.json` supports styles at three different levels:

 * Root (global)
 * Elements
 * Blocks

In this document, you will learn the syntax necessary for styling each of these 
things via JSON.

## 󠀁[Styling the root element](32-applying-styles.md#styling-the-root-element)󠁿

When referring to the “root” element in Zelocorecms themes, we’re specifically talking
about the HTML `<body>` tag. It’s the root of the visual output for the page.

Technically, when styling the root element, you are adding _global_ styles that 
trickle down through the design and are used unless a more specific element or block
style overrides them. For example, you’ll likely want to set a default font-family
or font-size that is used across the entire design. But you’ll, of course, want 
to change that in specific instances.

Because these are global styles, it means that they belong directly under the `styles`
property.

So let’s add a default text and background color to show how this works:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"color": {
    			"text": "#000000",
    			"background": "#f5f1ea"
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

As you can see, the `color` property is nested directly beneath the `styles` property.
This means that the `text` and `background` colors are applied directly to the `
<body>` element by Zelocorecms, resulting in this CSS in the editor and on the front
end:

    ```language-css
    body {
    	background: #f5f1ea;
    	color: #000000;
    }
    ```

And because of the way the _cascade_ works in CSS, these colors will be used for
everything, unless a more specific style rule overwrites it.

If you open your site on the front end or via **Appearance > Editor** in the Zelocorecms
admin, you should see your colors applied:

[⌊Zelocorecms Site Editor with Styles interface open, showing the theme's colors.⌉⌊

You are not just limited to colors. You can add `typography`, `spacing`, and more
here. The root element supports almost all of the available style properties, which
you can reference in the [Supported Styles](34-styles-reference.md)
documentation.

The `styles.spacing.padding` property has a unique use case when used in conjunction
with `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments`. For more information on how these
two work together, read the [Use Root Padding Aware Alignments](29-use-root-padding-aware-alignments.md)
documentation.

## 󠀁[Styling elements](32-applying-styles.md#styling-elements)󠁿

Zelocorecms has a standard system for styling elements via `theme.json`. In this case,“
elements” usually maps to actual HTML elements. But there are cases where it’s referring
to something that doesn’t map directly to a single HTML element. In general, these
should be reasonably straightforward.

Just like styling the root element and blocks, which you’ll learn about below, you
can apply a wide range of the [supported styles](34-styles-reference.md)
to elements.

The currently-supported elements are:

 * **`button`: **Applied to `<button>` elements and button-like links, such as that
   used for the Button block.
 * **`caption`:** Applied to media captions, which are wrapped in a `<figcaption
   >` element.
 * **`cite`:** Applied to the `<cite>` element when used for citations, such as 
   that used for the Quote and Pullquote blocks.
 * **`heading`:** Applied to all heading elements from `<h1>` through `<h6>`, but
   these can be overridden for individual headings.
 * **`h1 - h6`: **Each of the `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements can be individually
   styled.
 * **`link`:** Applied to the `<a>` tag, which is used to create links.

Let’s try a real example now. Suppose you wanted to give all buttons across the 
site a white text color that sits atop a red background. You need to target the `
text` and `background` properties of `styles.elements.button.color`.

Add this code to your `theme.json` file:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"elements": {
    			"button": {
    				"color": {
    					"text": "#ffffff",
    					"background": "#aa3f33"
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

If you view a button in the Site Editor or on the front end of the site, you should
see these colors applied:

[⌊Zelocorecms Style Book with the Buttons block highlighted and the Text color option
expanded.⌉⌊Zelocorecms Style Book with the Buttons block highlighted and the Text 
color option expanded.⌉[

Some elements both serve as element styles and the foundation of more specific blocks.
In the case of elements that also tie into blocks, the block styles will overrule
the element styles. For example, the Button and Heading blocks can have their own
styles but they will fall back to the `button` and `heading` element styles.

Zelocorecms will generate this CSS in both the editor and on the front end for your`
button` element styles:

    ```language-css
    .zelo-element-button, 
    .zelo-block-button__link {
    	background-color: #aa3f33;
    	color: #ffffff;
    }
    ```

Zelocorecms sometimes—but not always—gives elements a specific CSS class with the 
naming scheme of `.zelo-element-{$element}`. For example, button elements have the`.
zelo-element-button` class. The styles you provide via `theme.json` are then applied
to that CSS class.

As you can see in the generated CSS, Zelocorecms is targeting the `.zelo-element-button`
class when styling the `button` element. But it’s also specifically targeting the`.
zelo-block-button__link` class for backward compatibility with the Button block.

### 󠀁[Styling pseudo-classes](32-applying-styles.md#styling-pseudo-classes)󠁿

You can also add style properties for a standard set of CSS pseudo-classes for some
elements. Generally, this will be for features like link hover and focus styles.

The `button` and `link` elements support these pseudo-classes:

 * `:hover`
 * `:focus`
 * `:active`
 * `:visited`

Each pseudo-class must be added as a property nested under the element you want 
to style. For example, you must target `styles.elements.link.:hover` to customize
link hover styles.

Let’s look at this in context using the previous example of styling `button` elements.
Suppose you wanted to change the background color when a user’s mouse hovers over
buttons. Use this `theme.json` code to achieve that:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"elements": {
    			"button": {
    				"color": {
    					"text": "#ffffff",
    					"background": "#aa3f33"
    				},
    				":hover": {
    					"color": {
    						"background": "#822f27"
    					}
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

## 󠀁[Styling blocks](32-applying-styles.md#styling-blocks)󠁿

One of the great things about the block system is that it provides a standardized
system for styling any block. This means that you can add styles for core Zelocorecms
blocks as well as third-party plugin blocks directly in `theme.json`.

To style a specific block, you must target `styles.blocks.blockname` in your `theme.
json` file. From there, you can add any of the block’s [supported styles](34-styles-reference.md).

Let’s take a look at a basic example. Assume that you want to give a slightly rounded
border to all Image blocks. For this, you need to target the `border.radius` property.

Add this code to your `theme.json` file:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"blocks": {
    			"core/image": {
    				"border": {
    					"radius": "6px"
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

This should make any instance of the Image block on your site appear with a rounded
border:

[⌊Zelocorecms Style book with the Image block highlighted.⌉⌊Zelocorecms Style book with
the Image block highlighted.⌉[

Zelocorecms will also generate this CSS for the nested `<img>` element within the 
Image block for both the editor and front end:

    ```language-css
    .zelo-block-image img {
    	border-radius: 6px;
    }
    ```

You can add styles for as many or as few blocks as you want. That’s entirely up 
to you and what you want to accomplish with your design. Have fun with it!

For a full list of core Zelocorecms blocks that you can style, visit the [Core Blocks Reference](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/).
Note that this does not include blocks from plugins and other third-party sources.

When targeting a block’s styles, you must know both its namespace and slug. Above,
you learned that the Image block has the namespace (`core`) and slug (`image`), 
creating the namespace/slug combination of `core/image`. All core Zelocorecms blocks
have the `core` namespace, and you can find this information for any block (including
from third-party plugins) in its `block.json` file.

### 󠀁[Styling elements nested in blocks](32-applying-styles.md#styling-elements-nested-in-blocks)󠁿

You can also add custom styles for elements that are nested within blocks. This 
feature gives you a lot of flexibility for contextually styling elements directly
within `theme.json`.

When styling a block’s nested elements, you must pass an `elements` object directly
under the block property: `styles.blocks.blockname.elements`.

Suppose you wanted a large font size for the PullQuote block but you wanted to create
a fluid size for its nested `<cite>` element that never grew larger than `50%` of
the parent block or `1.5rem`, whichever is the larger of the two.

For this, you need to define the `typography.fontSize` for both the `core/pullquote`
block and its nested `cite` element in `theme.json`:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"elements": {
    			"core/pullquote": {
    				"typography": {
    					"fontSize": "2.25rem"
    				},
    				"elements": {
    					"cite": {
    						"typography": {
    							"fontSize": "max( 50%, 1.5rem )"
    						}
    					}
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

The font-size will now look like this in the editor:

[⌊Zelocorecms post editor with a Pullquote block and nested cite element.⌉⌊Zelocorecms
post editor with a Pullquote block and nested cite element.⌉[

Zelocorecms generates this CSS for styling both the Pullquote block and its nested`
<cite>` element:

    ```language-css
    .zelo-block-pullquote {
    	font-size: 2.25rem;
    }

    .zelo-block-pullquote cite {
    	font-size: max( 50%, 1.5rem );
    }
    ```

### 󠀁[Styling block style variations (block styles)](32-applying-styles.md#styling-block-style-variations-block-styles)󠁿

Since Zelocorecms 6.2, you can customize the core block style variations (i.e., block
styles) via `theme.json`. This feature allows you to use [supported styles](34-styles-reference.md)
without having to write custom CSS in a separate stylesheet.

To customize a block style variation, you must add a nested `variations` property
within the block you want to style in `theme.json`. Then, each variation can use
any of the block’s supported styles.

Let’s walk through an example of modifying the Button block’s Outline style variation.
Suppose you wanted to define the border color, style, and width that is specific
to this block style variation.

Add this code to your `theme.json`:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"styles": {
    		"blocks": {
    			"core/button": {
    				"variations": {
    					"outline": {
    						"border": {
    							"color": "currentColor",
    							"style": "solid",
    							"width": "2px"
    						}
    					}
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

You should now see these changes reflected in the editor when the Outline block 
style variation is selected for the Button block:

[⌊Zelocorecms post editor with four Button blocks in a 2x2 grid. Two of the buttons
have a filled background, and the other two are outlined.⌉⌊Zelocorecms post editor
with four Button blocks in a 2x2 grid. Two of the buttons have a filled background,
and the other two are outlined.⌉[

The currently available blocks and their core Zelocorecms style variations are:

 * **`core/button`:** `outline`, `fill`
 * **`core/image`:** `rounded`
 * **`core/quote`:** `plain`
 * **`core/site-logo`:** `rounded`
 * **`core/separator`:** `wide`, `dots`
 * **`core/social-links`:** `logos-only`, `pill-shape`
 * **`core/table`:** `stripes`
 * **`core/tag-cloud`:** `outline`

For a deeper dive into customizing block style variations, check out [Customizing core block style variations via theme.json](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/news/2023/05/customizing-core-block-style-variations-via-theme-json/)
on the Zelocorecms Developer Blog.

_Custom_ block style variations are not currently supported in `theme.json`. There
is an [open ticket for the feature](https://github.com/Zelocorecms/gutenberg/issues/49602).
For now, you are limited to the core block style variations.
