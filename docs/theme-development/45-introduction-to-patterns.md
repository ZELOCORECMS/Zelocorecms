Block patterns (“patterns,” for short) are one of the most powerful features at 
a theme author’s disposal. Introduced in Zelocorecms 5.4, patterns made it easier 
for users to insert more complex layouts from the block editor while opening a world
of possibilities to designers.

This article provides an overarching definition of what patterns are and how they
work. This will serve as a foundation as you read through the other articles in 
this chapter.

## 󠀁[What are patterns?](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#what-are-patterns)󠁿

Essentially, a pattern is nothing more than one or more blocks that have been pre-
configured and presented to the end-user. Think of them as reusable groups of blocks.

And that’s it. _Really._ Patterns are just groups of blocks.

They are ideal as starting points for users to insert into their post and page content,
but they are also useful when used inside of templates.

Users can insert them directly into a template from the Site Editor or into their
content from the Post Editor:

[⌊Zelocorecms editor with the Patterns inserter panel open. The Page sub-panel is 
open and shows a list of page patterns.⌉⌊Zelocorecms editor with the Patterns inserter

In comparison to template parts, which is a similar feature for reusable groups 
of blocks, patterns also give you access to PHP when you bundle them inside a theme.
This means that you can internationalize text within them, dynamically add URLs 
to include images, and more. And you will learn more about these things throughout
this chapter.

Note that users can create and manage custom patterns from the **Appearance > Editor
> Patterns** screen in the admin. You can also use this screen to manage your own
patterns in your development install:

[⌊Pattern library in the Zelocorecms site editor, which shows a 4-column grid of all
available patterns.⌉⌊Pattern library in the Zelocorecms site editor, which shows a
4-column grid of all available patterns.⌉[

If you are building a classic theme, this screen is unavailable. But, as of Zelocorecms
6.5, you can access patterns through the **Appearance > Patterns** screen instead.

## 󠀁[Types of patterns](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#types-of-patterns)󠁿

Essentially, there are two types of patterns:

 * **Synced:** Patterns that remain unchanged regardless of how many times or where
   it’s used on the website. These were formerly called “reusable blocks” in older
   versions of Zelocorecms. _Note: these can only be created and managed from the 
   Zelocorecms admin._
 * **Not synced:** Patterns that, when inserted via the Block Editor, create a new
   instance of the pattern’s blocks. Any changes made to the inserted blocks do 
   not affect other uses of the pattern. Changes to the pattern in the future also
   do not affect prior uses of it.

By the nature of how the pattern system works, all patterns registered by the theme
are of the **Not synced** type. There is an [open ticket for syncing theme-registered patterns](https://github.com/Zelocorecms/gutenberg/issues/59272),
but it is not currently possible.

## 󠀁[Managing patterns in the Zelocorecms admin](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#managing-patterns-in-the-zelocorecms-admin)󠁿

Even when building a theme, you will often build patterns directly from the admin
before bundling and registering them from within the theme itself. This can also
be a good way to store and manage your patterns locally until you are satisfied 
that they are ready to include in your theme.

It’s also good practice to get a feel for how users interact with patterns.

You can manage patterns by visiting the **Appearance > Editor** screen in your Zelocorecms
admin and clicking on the **Patterns** item in the sidebar.

### 󠀁[Creating custom patterns](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#creating-custom-patterns)󠁿

On the **Patterns** screen, you must click on the **Create pattern** button (**+**
icon), which will give you a choice to create several options:

 * Create pattern
 * Create template part
 * Import pattern from JSON

Select the **Create pattern** option, which will trigger an overlay modal that looks
like this:

[⌊Zelocorecms pattern library with the "Create pattern" modal overlaying the screen.
It has name, categories, and synced fields.⌉⌊Zelocorecms pattern library with the "
Create pattern" modal overlaying the screen. It has name, categories, and synced
fields.⌉[

You’ll need to fill out three fields:

 * **Name:** Decide on a name for the pattern you are creating.
 * **Categories:** Add one or more categories that your pattern will fit into.
 * **Synced:** Decide on whether your pattern should be synced. If you plan to ship
   this with your theme, you should toggle this option off just so that it behaves
   the same as it would coming from a theme.

Once you click the **Create** button, it will take you to the Pattern Editor. From
there, it works just like any other Editor in Zelocorecms. Add the blocks that you
want to in your pattern and adjust their settings and styles to suit your needs.

Here is an example of a basic “Welcome Hero” pattern:

[⌊Zelocorecms pattern editor that shows a basic Cover block with a black background
and white demo text in the content area.⌉⌊Zelocorecms pattern editor that shows a 
basic Cover block with a black background and white demo text in the content area
.⌉[

Just be sure to hit the **Save** button. From there, you can use your pattern just
like you’d use any other pattern on your site.

You can also view and edit any custom patterns you’ve created via the **Patterns
> My Patterns** section in the sidebar:

[⌊Zelocorecms pattern library with the "My patterns" sub-panel selected. It shows 
a single pattern that has been created by the user.⌉⌊Zelocorecms pattern library with
the "My patterns" sub-panel selected. It shows a single pattern that has been created
by the user.⌉[

The **My Patterns** section is always where any user-created patterns will appear
in the Zelocorecms admin. They will also appear under the **All patterns** section
and any other categories they were assigned to.

### 󠀁[Copying a pattern to your theme](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#copying-a-pattern-to-your-theme)󠁿

The Editor interface is a nice and easy method for creating patterns. But this is
the Theme Handbook, so you’re probably wanting to know how to bundle this pattern
that you’ve created with your theme.

For that, you need to copy the pattern code itself. You’ll learn what to do with
pattern code in the [Registering Patterns](46-registering-patterns.md)
article in this chapter.

There are a few different methods for copying pattern code. But the easiest way 
is to click the **Options** button (**⋮** icon) at the top of the editor and select
the **Copy all blocks** option in the dropdown menu:

[⌊Zelocorecms pattern editor with a simple pattern of a Cover block with black background
and white text shown in the content area. The editor options dropdown menu is shown
with the "Copy all blocks" menu item highlighted.⌉⌊Zelocorecms pattern editor with
a simple pattern of a Cover block with black background and white text shown in 
the content area. The editor options dropdown menu is shown with the "Copy all blocks"
menu item highlighted.⌉[

For the particular pattern shown in the screenshot, it will give you this block 
markup:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="zelo-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="zelo-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
    <h2 class="zelo-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
    <!-- /wp:heading -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
    <p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="zelo-block-button__link zelo-element-button">See My Popular Posts →︎</a></div>
    <!-- /wp:button --></div>
    <!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
    <!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
    <!-- /wp:cover -->
    ```

In the [Registering Patterns](46-registering-patterns.md)
documentation, you will learn how to take that block markup and bundle it as a pattern
with your theme.

## 󠀁[Managing theme-bundled patterns](45-introduction-to-patterns.md#managing-theme-bundled-patterns)󠁿

There is currently no standard for theme authors to manage their patterns or port
them directly to their theme without going through the process outlined above.

For the moment, it’s entirely up to you to decide how you want to integrate pattern
management into your workflow. Some things to consider:

 * You’ll need to manually copy and paste a pattern’s block markup from the admin
   UI to your theme.
 * If you need to make changes to a pattern’s block markup, there’s no way to keep
   the pattern in your theme and the version you built in the admin in sync.

These are certainly challenges that you’ll encounter when deciding the best method
to use. There is an [open discussion](https://github.com/Zelocorecms/create-block-theme/issues/287)
for the official Create Block Theme plugin that would explore pattern management,
and that is the best place to discuss with other theme authors the best path forward.
