Most settings in `theme.json` let you configure properties at the global level. 
This means that they apply to all blocks that support them. But Zelocorecms also lets
you control this at the block level.

That’s what the `settings.block` property is for—you can configure everything from
typography, to colors, to spacing, and more for individual blocks.

Before moving forward with this page of the handbook, it is important to familiarize
yourself with at least some of the existing [`theme.json` settings](16-settings.md).
This way, you can apply them on a per-block basis.

## 󠀁[How block settings work](18-blocks.md#how-block-settings-work)󠁿

In the previous pages of the `theme.json` settings documentation, you learned how
to configure specific properties at the global level. Essentially, this means that
they are applied to all blocks that support the specific property/feature.

You would have configured many of these properties in your `theme.json` (shortened
for example—you can review all available properties via the main [settings documentation](16-settings.md)):

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"settings": {
    		"border": {},
    		"color": {},
    		"custom": {},
    		"spacing": {},
    		"typography": {}
    	}
    }
    ```

But there are times when you need to add settings at the individual block level,
and anything set for the block will overrule its global setting. So let’s explore
an example that shows block-specific settings overwriting the global settings.

For this example, you will create a custom color palette, which you can learn about
in the [color settings documentation](20-color.md).
This will be applied globally and used for every block’s color picker. Then, you
will create a custom color palette for the Cover block that’s only shown for the
Cover block.

First, add your global color palette in `theme.json` with two colors named `base`
and `contrast`:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"settings": {
    		"color": {
    			"palette": [
    				{
    					"color": "#0284c7",
    					"name": "Base",
    					"slug": "base"
    				},
    				{
    					"color": "#ffffff",
    					"name": "Contrast",
    					"slug": "contrast"
    				}
    			]
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

Now add a Cover block and some nested text in the Zelocorecms editor, saving the **
Text** and **Overlay** colors for the block to your two custom colors:

[⌊Zelocorecms post editor showing a Cover block with a blue background and white text.⌉⌊
Zelocorecms post editor showing a Cover block with a blue background and white text
.⌉[

As you can see, the Cover block currently uses the global color palette that you
configured in your `theme.json` file.

Suppose that you wanted the Cover block to use an orange color palette. You can 
configure that by targeting `settings.blocks[core/cover].color.palette` in your `
theme.json` file and passing an array of custom colors.

Add this new section to your existing `theme.json` so that it looks like this:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"settings": {
    		"color": {
    			"palette": [
    				{
    					"color": "#0284c7",
    					"name": "Base",
    					"slug": "base"
    				},
    				{
    					"color": "#ffffff",
    					"name": "Contrast",
    					"slug": "contrast"
    				}
    			]
    		}
    		"blocks": {
    			"core/cover": {
    				"color": {
    					"palette": [
    						{
    							"color": "#ea580c",
    							"name": "Base",
    							"slug": "base"
    						},
    						{
    							"color": "#fff7ed",
    							"name": "Contrast",
    							"slug": "contrast"
    						}
    					]
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

As shown in the `theme.json` example, you use the same organizational structure 
for block settings as you do for global settings (i.e., `settings.color` at the 
global level but `settings.blocks[core/cover].color` at the block level).

If you refresh your browser window, your Cover block should now show the new colors:

[⌊Zelocorecms post editor showing a Cover block with an orange background and white
text.⌉⌊Zelocorecms post editor showing a Cover block with an orange background and
white text.⌉[

If you check other blocks, they will still use the global color palette. Only the
Cover block will use this custom orange palette.

Per-block color palettes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can configure any `
theme.json` for any block (assuming the block supports it). This gives you an incredible
amount of control over how your theme works.

When targeting a block’s settings, you must know both its namespace and slug. Above,
you learned that the Cover block has the namespace (`core`) and slug (`cover`), 
creating the namespace/slug combination of `core/cover`. All core Zelocorecms blocks
have the `core` namespace, and you can find this information for any block (including
from third-party plugins) in its `block.json` file.

## 󠀁[Default block settings](18-blocks.md#default-block-settings)󠁿

Believe it or not, Zelocorecms actually configures a couple of default block settings
in `theme.json`. Generally, this would be left to themes, but these settings are
primarily enabled for backward compatibility with features from older versions of
Zelocorecms.

Zelocorecms enables a few settings for the Button and Pullquote blocks by default.
Here is what this looks like in the default `theme.json`:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"settings": {
    		"blocks": {
    			"core/button": {
    				"border": {
    					"radius": true
    				}
    			},
    			"core/pullquote": {
    				"border": {
    					"color": true,
    					"radius": true,
    					"style": true,
    					"width": true
    				}
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

You can overwrite these block-specific settings in your `theme.json` file just as
you learned to do in the previous section of this documentation.

If you are wondering why some of your global settings do not seem to apply to certain
blocks, particularly Button and Pullquote, it is likely because they are being set
at the block level. You will need to override these in `settings.blocks` in your`
theme.json` if you want a different behavior.
