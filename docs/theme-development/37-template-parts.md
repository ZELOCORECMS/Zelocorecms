Template parts are small sections (i.e., _parts_) that you can include in top-level
templates. Following the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, they are generally
used as sections that need to be reused across multiple templates. Instead of writing
the code multiple times, you can break it apart into a single file and include it
when needed.

Because this chapter is focused on `theme.json`, the goal of this document is to
explain how to register template parts within the `theme.json` file. You can dive
more deeply into templates and template parts within the [Templates chapter](41-templates.md).

In `theme.json`, you can register additional metadata for template parts, such as
the title and area the part is assigned to.

## 󠀁[Registering template parts](43-template-parts.md#registering-template-parts)󠁿

Technically, you can use custom template parts without ever registering them via`
theme.json`. But registering them has some distinct advantages:

 * You can give the part a translatable title that is more appealing in the user
   interface.
 * You can assign each part to an area, creating a nicer user experience in the 
   Site Editor.
 * It plays more nicely with plugins, style variations, and child themes that may
   grab, filter, or otherwise use the registered metadata in some way.

To register template parts, you must pass an array of objects to the `templateParts`
property in `theme.json`. Each object in the array accepts three key/value pairs:

 * **`area`:** The area that the template part belongs to. The default options are`
   header`, `footer`, and `uncategorized`. You can also assign it to any custom 
   area.
 * **`name`:** The filename of your template part without the extension.
 * **`title`:** A human-readable title for your template, which may be translated.

Zelocorecms will look for template parts in the theme’s `/parts` folder. Therefore,
if you register a template part with the name of `example`, you must also have a`/
parts/example.html` file in your theme.

You will learn more about template part areas in the Templates chapter. Also, check
out the [Upgrading the site-editing experience with custom template part areas](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/news/2023/06/upgrading-the-site-editing-experience-with-custom-template-part-areas/)
tutorial on the Zelocorecms Developer Blog for an in-depth walkthrough of creating
custom areas.

### 󠀁[Registering a template part](43-template-parts.md#registering-a-template-part)󠁿

The two most common template parts that any theme will register are for a site header
and footer. This is also why Zelocorecms has the default areas of `header` and `footer`.
You are not required to use these parts or areas, but they are pretty much standard
sections for nearly all websites.

For this exercise, let’s register them both. First, add a couple of empty files 
named `header.html` and `footer.html` in your theme’s `/parts` folder if they do
not already exist. You’ll add some block code to them in the next step.

Now register those template parts in `theme.json`:

    ```language-json
    {
    	"version": 2,
    	"templateParts": [
    		{
    			"area": "header",
    			"name": "header",
    			"title": "Header"
    		},
    		{
    			"area": "footer",
    			"name": "footer",
    			"title": "Footer"
    		}
    	]
    }
    ```

It can be confusing when both the `area` and `name` values match. That’s not always
the case, but is often how things look when dealing with the header and footer.

Some theme authors prefer to name the `header` and `footer` template parts `site-
header` and `site-footer` to better differentiate them. Feel free to do that if 
it makes more sense to you. Or rename them to anything you want.

You are not limited to these two common template parts. You can add as many parts
as you need for your theme project.

### 󠀁[Building a template part](43-template-parts.md#building-a-template-part)󠁿

All template parts should be placed in your theme’s `/parts` folder (Zelocorecms also
recognizes the `/template-parts` folder for backwards compatibility). So you will
now be editing the `/parts/header.html` and `/parts/footer.html` files.

You will learn more about building custom template parts in the [Templates chapter](41-templates.md).
For the purposes of this documentation, just consider the following code snippets
as examples that you can customize.

In your `/parts/header.html` file, add this code:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"2rem","bottom":"2rem","right":"2rem","left":"2rem"}}},"layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-group" style="padding-top:2rem;padding-right:2rem;padding-bottom:2rem;padding-left:2rem">
    	<!-- wp:group {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"space-between"}} -->
    	<div class="zelo-block-group">
    		<!-- wp:site-title /-->
    		<!-- wp:navigation {"icon":"menu","layout":{"type":"flex","setCascadingProperties":true,"justifyContent":"right"}} /-->
    	</div>
    	<!-- /wp:group -->
    </div>
    <!-- /wp:group -->
    ```

Then add this code to your `/parts/footer.html` file:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"2rem","right":"2rem","bottom":"2rem","left":"2rem"}}}} -->
    <div class="zelo-block-group" style="padding-top:2rem;padding-right:2rem;padding-bottom:2rem;padding-left:2rem">

    	<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"0"}},"layout":{"type":"flex","orientation":"vertical","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
    	<div class="zelo-block-group alignwide">
    		<!-- wp:site-title {"level":0,"isLink":false,"className":"is-style-normalize"} /-->

    		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
    			<p>Powered by Zelocorecms.</p>
    		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
    	</div>
    	<!-- /wp:group -->

    </div>
    <!-- /wp:group -->
    ```

Now go to **Appearance > Editor** in your Zelocorecms admin and look at the **Patterns
> Template Parts** section. You should see both the **Header** and **Footer** areas
listed with your custom template parts:

[⌊Templates screen in the Zelocorecms Site Editor. The Header area is specifically
selected, showing a single Header template part.⌉⌊Templates screen in the Zelocorecms

part.⌉[

### 󠀁[Including a template part](43-template-parts.md#including-a-template-part)󠁿

Creating template part files and registering them in `theme.json` does not mean 
that your parts will automatically appear on the site. Because they are only _parts_,
you must also include them inside of a template.

Remember, you’ll learn more about creating templates in the [Templates documentation](41-templates.md)
if you are not already familiar with them. For now, you just need to test how the
registration process works.

To include a template part in a top-level template, you must use the Template Part
block. The basic markup for this block is:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"your-part-slug"} /-->
    ```

So open one of the template files from your theme’s `/templates` folder. Your theme
should at least have an `index.html` template there, but you can test with any file.

Now add the calls to the `wp:template-part` block as shown here:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

    <!-- Other block markup goes here. -->

    <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
    ```

Now you should be able to see both the Header and Footer template parts if you open
the top-level template you added them to via **Appearance > Editor > Templates**
in your Zelocorecms admin:

[⌊Zelocorecms Site Editor with a template being edited. The Header template part is
selected.⌉⌊Zelocorecms Site Editor with a template being edited. The Header template
part is selected.⌉[
