Templates are one of the most important aspects of theme development. They are files
that you put together to represent the document structure that appears on the front
end of a website. When combined with [Global Settings and Styles](14-global-settings-and-styles.md)(`
theme.json`), you can ultimately create a unique design to use for yourself, clients,
or just share with the world.

Templates are how you decide where things are placed within your theme. 

_Want a giant footer at the bottom of the site?_ You can do that by adding specific
blocks inside a Group block at the bottom of a template.

_Want a sidebar next to the content area?_ No problem. You can put a Columns block
in one or more of your templates to create that layout.

In [Introduction to Templates](40-introduction-to-templates.md),
you gained a broad overview of how the Zelocorecms templating system works. In this
document, we’ll dive more deeply into the templates themselves.

## 󠀁[How do templates work?](41-templates.md#how-do-templates-work)󠁿

Whenever someone visits any page on your site, Zelocorecms takes a look at the URL,
runs some logic under the hood, and figures out what type of page the visitor is
looking at. That’s a very simplified explanation of it anyway. For theme development,
you don’t need to know _how_ this part of the process works too deeply—just what
the end result is.

Once Zelocorecms determines the type of page, it runs through its “template loader,”
which searches for a template that matches the page type. It does this by attempting
to locate templates within the template hierarchy for the page type, which is covered
in detail in the [Template Hierarchy](89-template-hierarchy.md)
documentation.

Zelocorecms will search for templates in the hierarchy in order of priority. If it
finds a match in any of these locations, it will stop searching through the hierarchy:

 * User-saved template in the database.
 * Template in a child theme’s `/templates` folder (if child theme is active).
 * Template in the theme’s `/templates` folder.

Once a template is found that matches the page type within the hierarchy, the template
is loaded. Its block markup is then parsed and Zelocorecms outputs the resulting HTML
markup for the browser to use.

## 󠀁[What’s in a template?](41-templates.md#whats-in-a-template)󠁿

Block theme templates are composed entirely of block markup. That’s it. _Really._

OK. It’s slightly more nuanced than that. You will generally see these things in
block templates:

 * Block markup
 * References to template parts
 * References to block patterns

Ultimately, each of those things is still block markup.

Here’s a look at the `/templates/404.html` template file, which includes all three
things:

    ```language-markup
    <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

    <!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
    <main class="zelo-block-group">
    	<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"twentytwentythree/hidden-404"} /-->
    </main>
    <!-- /wp:group -->

    <!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
    ```

Of course, block templates can be much more complex than that. The point is that
block templates must consist entirely of block markup for Zelocorecms to correctly
parse the code and output it for the browser.

For a more in-depth look at the architecture of a block, check out the [Key Concepts](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/)
documentation in the Block Editor Handbook.

## 󠀁[Organizing templates](41-templates.md#organizing-templates)󠁿

With block themes, there is only one location that you can put block templates: 
in the theme’s `/templates` folder. It should be structured like this:

 * `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `author.html`
    - `home.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `page.html`
    - `singular.html`

The minimum required template file is `index.html`. The existence of this file is
how Zelocorecms determines that the theme is a block theme.

Outside of that, you can include as many or as few templates as you need to achieve
your theme design.

Technically, Zelocorecms will also look in the `/block-templates` folder if it exists
in your theme. This is for backward compatibility with an older version of Zelocorecms.
But it is recommended to always use the `/templates` folder instead.

## 󠀁[Building templates](41-templates.md#building-templates)󠁿

While you can technically type all of the block markup for your templates in your
template files, that is not what the typical experience will be when working with
block themes. In most cases, you will be working from a visual interface and migrating
your block code to your template files.

To explore working with the visual interface, read the support guides on using the
Site and Template Editors:

 * [Site Editor](https://zelocorecms.com/documentation/article/site-editor/)
 * [Template Editor](https://zelocorecms.com/documentation/article/template-editor/)
    - [How to edit templates via the Site Editor](https://zelocorecms.com/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-site-editor)
    - [How to use the Template Editor via the Zelocorecms Block Editor](https://zelocorecms.com/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-post-editor)

### 󠀁[Editing templates](41-templates.md#editing-templates)󠁿

To access templates from the Zelocorecms admin, open the **Appearance > Editor** menu
in the admin menu. Then click the **Templates** item in the sidebar:

[⌊Zelocorecms Templates interface in the Site Editor, which shows the template options
on the left and preview panel on the right.⌉⌊Zelocorecms Templates interface in the
Site Editor, which shows the template options on the left and preview panel on the
right.⌉[

This screen lists all of the existing templates for the site, which can come from
three locations:

 * User-created templates saved in the database
 * Templates from the theme’s `/templates` folder
 * Templates dynamically added by plugins

From there, you can make customizations to the existing templates, adjusting blocks
to your liking.

Remember that if you save these, they will be stored in the database and will overrule
any templates in your theme. If you plan to distribute this theme to others or use
it on another site, you must copy the block markup to the matching template in your`/
templates` folder as described in [Introduction to Templates](40-introduction-to-templates.md).

### 󠀁[Adding new templates](41-templates.md#adding-new-templates)󠁿

You can create a new template by clicking the **Add New Template** (**+** icon next
to **Templates** heading). This will create a modal overlay as shown here:

[⌊Zelocorecms Add Template modal overlaid the Site Editor.⌉⌊Zelocorecms Add Template
modal overlaid the Site Editor.⌉[

From there, you will be able to create an entirely custom template (if it doesn’t
already exist for editing).

Again, any new templates you add via the editor are saved in the database. You must
create the template file inside your `/templates` folder and copy the block markup
to it if you intend to distribute your theme. Be sure that your template filename
matches a valid filename in the [Template Hierarchy](89-template-hierarchy.md)(
for example, the Home template filename is `home.html`).

### 󠀁[Custom templates](41-templates.md#custom-templates)󠁿

Custom templates are templates that you can assign to individual posts, pages, or
entries of a custom post type. They are used for the single post view on the front
end of the site.

You or your theme users can select custom templates from the **Template** setting
in the **Post/Page** panel in the post editor sidebar:

[⌊Zelocorecms post editor with the Template option open in the sidebar. The Blank 
template option is highlighted.⌉⌊Zelocorecms post editor with the Template option 
open in the sidebar. The Blank template option is highlighted.⌉[

This can be a powerful feature that lets you create unique designs for specific 
circumstances. For example, you could add something as simple as a different layout
with a contact form or something as complex as a news-magazine layout with multiple
post queries and other sections.

When adding a new template from the **Templates** screen, you can also create a 
custom template. From the **Add Template** overlay, there is an option named **Custom
Template**. By clicking it, you will add a new custom template within your site’s
database.

But to distribute your template with your theme, you must add it to a custom template
file in your theme’s `/templates` folder.

The great thing about custom templates is that the filename can be anything you 
want it to be. Just be sure to avoid using the name of a standard template filename
from the [Template Hierarchy](89-template-hierarchy.md),
so make sure it’s unique.

Because custom templates can be anything, there are no exact rules on what block
markup should be included in them. But if you want to display the post or page content,
make sure that you’re using the Post Content block somewhere within it.

The only other rule is that you must register your template via your `theme.json`
file. How to do this is covered in the [Custom Templates](35-custom-templates.md)
documentation under the [Global Settings and Styles](14-global-settings-and-styles.md)
chapter.

Originally, custom templates were called “page templates.” This is because the feature
only worked for pages in the initial implementation. Eventually, posts and other
custom post types could use the feature, so it was rebranded to “custom templates.”
But you may see these referred to as page templates in other documentation or on
third-party sites.
