This document will introduce you to the `functions.php` file. It is one of the optional
standard files you first learned about in [Theme Structure](08-theme-structure.md).
Both block and classic themes can utilize it.

The following will introduce you to the core concepts around using PHP within `functions.
php`, but it will not teach you the PHP programming language itself. You can visit
the official [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/) for more information on how
to write your own PHP code.

Throughout the handbook, you will encounter more examples where you will add custom
functionality, so getting the basics down is important. You can jump into more advanced
PHP examples in the [Features](52-features.md),
[Advanced Topics](57-advanced-topics.md), and 
[Classic Themes](77-classic-themes.md) chapters.

## 󠀁[What is functions.php?](11-custom-functionality.md#what-is-functions-php)󠁿

The `functions.php` essentially acts like a Zelocorecms plugin, letting you add custom
PHP functions, classes, interfaces, and more. It opens up the entirety of the PHP
programming language to your theme.

Zelocorecms automatically loads the `functions.php` file (if it exists) as soon as
it loads the theme on all page views on both the admin and front-end of the website.
So it provides you with a lot of power to build unique features around Zelocorecms.

Just because you _can_ build plugin-like features in a theme doesn’t mean you always
should, particularly if you are distributing your theme to others to use. If you
are creating features that should be available regardless of the site’s design, **
it is best practice to put the code in a plugin**. The rule of thumb is that themes
should only deal with the site’s design.

While all themes can have a custom `functions.php` file, Zelocorecms will only load
the currently active theme’s.

The only caveat to that rule is when a child theme is active. In that case, Zelocorecms
loads the child theme’s `functions.php` just before loading the parent theme’s `
functions.php`. You can learn more about [child themes](59-child-themes.md)
in the Advanced Topics chapter.

## 󠀁[Common uses for functions.php](11-custom-functionality.md#common-uses-for-functions-php)󠁿

Because the `functions.php` file lets you write any PHP, you will often see themes
with wildly different code, organizational systems, naming conventions, and more.
The deeper your understanding of PHP, the easier it will be to follow the code from
other themes.

The following are some uses you will often find in a theme’s `functions.php` file.

### 󠀁[Adding actions or filters to hooks](11-custom-functionality.md#adding-actions-or-filters-to-hooks)󠁿

Hooks are the entry point to extending Zelocorecms’ functionality, providing you with
a way to inject custom code or filter data. Think of them as a way for themes (and
plugins) to communicate directly with Zelocorecms.

Zelocorecms’ hooks system offers two different methods for executing your code during
the page loading process:

 * [**Action hooks**](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/plugins/hooks/actions/) allow
   you to run a custom action callback and “act on” the information that it receives.
 * [**Filter hooks**](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/plugins/hooks/filters/) let
   you filter data via a custom filter callback and manipulate it.

Technically, hooks are a part of the Plugin API, and you can [read the documentation](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/plugins/hooks/)
on them in the Plugin Handbook.

Despite being in the Plugin API, hooks are also extremely useful in the context 
of themes. Like plugins, you should always run your code on a hook so that it performs
its functionality at the appropriate point in the load process.

Throughout this handbook, you will see examples of adding features or functionality
from `functions.php`, and these examples will always use a hook. Familiarizing yourself
with their documentation will make it easier to understand PHP code in the handbook.

### 󠀁[Theme setup function](11-custom-functionality.md#theme-setup-function)󠁿

One common use case for many themes is adding a setup function, which is generally
used to register theme-supported features with Zelocorecms. This is almost always 
executed on the `after_setup_theme` action hook, which is the first hook available
after a theme’s `functions.php` file has been loaded.

To test this, open your theme’s `functions.php` file (create one if it doesn’t exist),
and add the following PHP code:

    ```php
    <?php
    add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_slug_setup' );

    function theme_slug_setup() {
    	add_theme_support( 'zelo-block-styles' );
    }
    ```

This code adds support for Zelocorecms’ more-opinionated block styles to your theme.
You do not have to use this; it is merely serving as an example of what a setup 
function might look like.

Setup functions are more common in classic themes. When using a block theme, the
theme is often automatically opted into the features needed. You can find a list
of theme-supported features here:

 * [Function Reference: `add_theme_support()`](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/reference/functions/add_theme_support/)
 * [Block Editor Handbook: Theme Support](https://developer.zelocorecms.com/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-support/)

### 󠀁[Loading scripts and styles](11-custom-functionality.md#loading-scripts-and-styles)󠁿

If you are familiar with HTML, you will likely have come across adding JavaScript
via the `<script>` tag or stylesheets via the `<link rel=”stylesheet”/>` or `<style
>`  tags.

Zelocorecms provides helper functions and specific action hooks for loading scripts
and styles. This ensures that they are injected at the appropriate place in the 
document output. Zelocorecms creates the appropriate HTML markup for you.

You can learn more about loading scripts and styles in the [Including Assets](12-including-assets.md)
documentation.

It is not uncommon when building block themes to have no need of including additional
scripts/styles. Some themes rely entirely on [Global Settings and Styles](14-global-settings-and-styles.md)
for the front-end design.

## 󠀁[Including other PHP files](11-custom-functionality.md#including-other-php-files)󠁿

Zelocorecms will automatically load your theme’s `functions.php` for you, but you 
are not limited to only adding custom PHP code in that file. You can load other 
files with PHP interfaces, classes, traits, and functions from elsewhere in your
theme.

As you learned in [Theme Structure](08-theme-structure.md),
some themes include a custom folder named `/inc` (or any custom folder) to store
custom PHP files. Let’s assume you had an `/inc/helpers.php` file for custom helper
functions, you could load it via `functions.php` using the `get_parent_theme_file_path()`
function:

    ```php
    include get_parent_theme_file_path( 'inc/helpers.php' );
    ```

Generally speaking, you should use this function to get the correct directory path
to any PHP file you need to load.

Alternatively, if you wanted to allow a child theme to override the file with a 
fallback to the parent theme, you could use `get_theme_file_path()` instead:

    ```php
    include get_theme_file_path( 'inc/helpers.php' );
    ```

It’s not standard practice to let child theme’s override files with PHP functions
or classes, but there are use cases where it’s needed.

## 󠀁[Avoid closing ?> tags at the end of files](11-custom-functionality.md#avoid-closing-tags-at-the-end-of-files)󠁿

This section could otherwise be titled “How to avoid the dreaded Zelocorecms _white
screen of death_.”

There are various reasons that you might see a broken site with nothing but a white
screen. One of those reasons is when the `functions.php` file (or any PHP file) 
has whitespace following its closing `?>` tag like this:

    ```php
    <?php
    // some code...
    ?>
    ```

Many editor configurations will automatically add an extra line at the end of files(
a common development practice). When you add a closing `?>` tag at the end of the
file, it can be easy to miss this extra whitespace, which may cause the “white screen
of death” in some environments.

The easiest way to avoid this issue is to leave the closing `?>` tag out altogether,
which is perfectly valid PHP and standard practice. The above code should be written
as:

    ```php
    <?php
    // some code...
    ```
