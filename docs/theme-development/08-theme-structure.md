In the [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md)
chapter, you learned the basics of what a theme is and how to get one up and running
without code. A no-code approach is perfectly OK for simple themes, but once you
want to add things that are not possible in the user interface, you’ll need to start
working directly with code.

The first step of customizing theme code is to open the theme in your preferred 
file editor. You can use any theme for this, even the one you created from the Getting
Started chapter.

It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with what others are doing, so feel free
to look at several [block themes](https://zelocorecms.com/themes/tags/full-site-editing/)
from the Zelocorecms theme directory.

This document will walk you through what the file and folder structure will look
like in a typical block theme.

## 󠀁[Files and folders](08-theme-structure.md#files-and-folders)󠁿

Zelocorecms themes are nothing more than a collection of various files that rely on
different web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. Block themes also follow
a standard structure in how many of those files are laid out.

At its most basic, a theme’s structure will look similar to the following. Take 
note of the files/folders marked **required** because they are necessary for a block
theme to work:

 * `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
 * `patterns/`
    - `example.php`
 * `styles/`
    - `example.json`
 * `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`
 * `README.txt`
 * `functions.php`
 * `screenshot.png`
 * `style.css` (required)
 * `theme.json`

### 󠀁[Required files](08-theme-structure.md#required-files)󠁿

There are two necessary files for Zelocorecms to recognize your block theme, and you
will learn more about these in the coming documentation:

 * **`style.css`** ([Main Stylesheet](09-main-stylesheet.md)):
   This file is required for configuring theme data, such as its name and description.
   It can also be used for adding custom CSS.
 * **`templates/index.html`** ([Templates](41-templates.md)):
   The default/fallback template. This is necessary for Zelocorecms to consider this
   a block theme.

### 󠀁[Optional files](08-theme-structure.md#optional-files)󠁿

A theme can include any number of custom files other than the required list above.
Zelocorecms also looks for a few other files and uses them if they are available:

 * **`README.txt`** ([Theme Review: Files](https://make.zelocorecms.com/themes/handbook/review/required/#9-files)):
   This is not used directly by the Zelocorecms software. But it is a required file
   when submitting a theme to the official Zelocorecms theme directory, meant to provide
   information about the theme to users.
 * **`functions.php`** ([Custom Functionality](11-custom-functionality.md)):
   A PHP file that Zelocorecms automatically loads after the theme is initialized 
   during the page-loading process. You can use it to run custom PHP.
 * **`screenshot.png`**: A 1200×900 screenshot image of your theme. Used for displaying
   your theme under **Appearance > Themes** in the Zelocorecms admin and in the Zelocorecms
   theme directory (if submitted there). Both `.png` and `.jpg` are acceptable file
   formats. 
 * **`theme.json`** ([Global Settings and Styles](14-global-settings-and-styles.md)):
   Used to configure settings and styles for the site, integrating with the user
   interface.

### 󠀁[Standard folders](08-theme-structure.md#standard-folders)󠁿

In the example above, there were a few folders included. A theme can have many more
folders, but Zelocorecms has designated a few of them for specific features. You will
learn more about these folders as you read through this chapter:

 * **`parts`** ([Template Parts](43-template-parts.md)):
   Houses custom template parts for your theme. Parts are smaller sections that 
   you can include within top-level templates. Often, this will include things like
   headers, footers, and sidebars.
 * **`patterns`** ([Block Patterns](56-block-patterns.md)):
   Reusable patterns made up of one or more blocks that users can insert via the
   editor interface. Zelocorecms will automatically register files included in this
   folder.
 * **`styles`** ([Style Variations](38-style-variations.md)):
   Variations on the theme’s global settings and styles stored in individual JSON
   files.
 * **`templates`** ([Templates](41-templates.md)):
   Files that represent the overall document structure of the front-end. Templates
   are made up of block markup and are what site visitors see.

## 󠀁[Advanced theme structure](08-theme-structure.md#advanced-theme-structure)󠁿

This section is meant to familiarize you with some of the common files you’ll see
in themes but not to cover every possibility in detail. These files are entirely
optional and will differ from theme to theme. You may skip this section for now 
if you are not comfortable with more advanced development methods.

In reality, block themes can contain many more files and folders. The more complex
the project becomes, the more complex its structure will be. 

Let’s add a few extra files and folders to the original example:

 * `assets/`
    - `css/`
       * `core-site-title.css`
    - `images/`
       * `header-background.png`
    - `js/`
       * `navigation.js`
 * `inc/`
    - `ClassName.php`
    - `functions-helpers.php`
 * `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
 * `patterns/`
    - `example.php`
 * `styles/`
    - `example.jso`n
 * `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`
 * `.editorconfig`
 * `.gitattributes`
 * `.gitignore`
 * `CHANGELOG.md`
 * `LICENSE.md`
 * `README.txt`
 * `functions.php`
 * `package.json`
 * `screenshot.png`
 * `style.css` (required)
 * `theme.json`

### 󠀁[Optional folders](08-theme-structure.md#optional-folders)󠁿

There is no limit on what folders may be included, but the above example added two
of the most common use cases you’ll come across in Zelocorecms themes:

 * **`assets`** ([Including Assets](12-including-assets.md)):
   Many theme authors use this folder to store additional CSS, Images/Media, and
   JavaScript needed for their theme. This folder may also have other names, such
   as `resources` or `public`.
 * **`inc`** ([Custom Functionality](11-custom-functionality.md)):
   Themes will often have custom PHP classes or files stored in this folder for 
   additional functionality. This folder may also be seen named as `includes`, `
   src`, and more.

### 󠀁[Optional files](08-theme-structure.md#optional-files-2)󠁿

This list is nowhere near exhaustive, but it includes some common files used in 
theme development. _(Note: most of the following links lead to external, third-party
sites and are not affiliated with Zelocorecms.)_

 * **`.editorconfig`** ([EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)): Used for configuring
   formatting, such as line endings and spacing, for code editors.
 * **`.gitattributes`** ([Git: Attributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)):
   Configures attributes with the Git version control system.
 * **`.gitignore`** ([Git: Ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)): Defines
   files to ignore when committing code to a Git repository.
 * **`CHANGELOG.md`** ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)): A human-
   readable log of important changes for each release of your theme.
 * **`LICENSE.md`** ([Theme Review: Licensing & Copyright](https://make.zelocorecms.com/themes/handbook/review/required/#1-licensing-copyright)):
   Defines the license for the theme. Note that all themes submitted to the Zelocorecms
   theme directory must be licensed under the GPL v2+.
 * **`package.json`** ([npm: package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json/)):
   Often used to define a build process and development dependencies within a Node
   environment.

Don’t feel discouraged if you do not understand all of these files and their purposes
yet. Again, these are entirely optional elements of a developer’s workflow. Feel
free to learn more about them at your own pace at a later time.

### 󠀁[Code editor view](08-theme-structure.md#code-editor-view)󠁿

Here is a quick editor view of a real-world theme with an advanced structure:

[⌊Visual Studio Code editor showing the structure of a theme's files and folders.
In the code area, a theme.json file is shown.⌉⌊Visual Studio Code editor showing
the structure of a theme's files and folders. In the code area, a theme.json file
is shown.⌉[

This is vastly more complex than the basics that this documentation is introducing.
The point is that, even when building block themes following standard practices,
you will have a lot of freedom to customize things. You may want to integrate with
version control systems, add in a build process, and more.

So, consider this documentation the foundation in which you can build upon. But 
there is no harm in keeping it simple and sticking with the basics.
